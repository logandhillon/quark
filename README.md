# Quark

Quark is a user-friendly app to dive into the realm of quantum computing through simple block-based coding.

## Inspiration

Just as many individuals kickstarted their programming journey through block-coding, including myself, our team is motivated to extend this approach to quantum coding. Despite the inherent complexity of quantum computing, we aspire to democratize access to this fascinating field. By providing a user-friendly platform, we aim to lower the barriers to entry, fostering a new generation of quantum developers equipped with the foundational knowledge of quantum computing.

## What it does

Venturing into the world of quantum computing can be intimidating due to its complexity. Quark simplifies this journey by providing a user-friendly environment where individuals can experiment with quantum computing concepts, making it accessible for anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of this cutting-edge technology.

## How we built it

The backend of Quark is built using IBM's quPython library, a library that packages a rudimentary version of Qiskit, a quantum computing library. The frontend resembles the very popular block coding website Scratch, by MIT.

## Challenges we ran into

The overarching challenge while creating Quark was understanding the foundationals of quantum computing and how a quantum particle, or qubit, is programmed. Another challenge was creating a webapp that was attempting to meet the standard of quality of Scratch's webapp. Creating a frontend with a usable, human-oriented UI that can seamlessly provide all the required data to the backend was definitely a challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Quark is a major milestone for providing quantum computing to everyone, not just experts, and we are very proud of being able to achieve this. The journey to creating Quark also provided us with rudimentary knowledge of computing with qubits.

## What we learned

During the production of Quark, our team mainly learned the true value of teamwork and collaboration. Many features of Quark may truly not have been possible without cooperation.

## What's next for Quark

There are many plans for Quark in the near future, including:
- A visual output window representing qubit states
- Simulation of quantum entanglement
