# Quark

Quark is a user-friendly app to dive into the realm of quantum computing through simple block-based coding.

## Inspiration

Just as many individuals kickstarted their programming journey through block-coding, including myself, our team is motivated to extend this approach to quantum coding. Despite the inherent complexity of quantum computing, we aspire to democratize access to this fascinating field. By providing a user-friendly platform, we aim to lower the barriers to entry, fostering a new generation of quantum developers equipped with the foundational knowledge of quantum computing.

## What it does

Venturing into the world of quantum computing can be intimidating due to its complexity. Quark simplifies this journey by providing a user-friendly environment where individuals can experiment with quantum computing concepts, making it accessible for anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of this cutting-edge technology.
